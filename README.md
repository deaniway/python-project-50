## Project: Difference Calculator


A difference calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. 
This is a popular task, for which there are many online services, such as jsondiff.
A similar mechanism is, for example, used when outputting tests or automatically tracking changes in configuration files.


### This is  use next tools:

| Tools  | Version |
|:------:|:-------:|
| python |  3.11   |
| poetry |  1.6.1  |
| pytest |  7.4.4  |
| flake8 |  6.1.0  |



### To get started, you need to perform the following operations:

| Step |                                   Instruction                                   |
|:----:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  1   | Clone he repository to your PC:<br/>`github.com/deaniway/python-project-50.git` |
|  2   |                   Go to repository<br/>`cd python-project-50`                   |
|  3   |         Installing the application on your computer<br/>`make install`          | 

*Alternative installation option:* `python3 -m pip install --user git+github.com/deaniway/python-project-50.git`

*P.S.* *You must have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) installed*
