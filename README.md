## Project: Difference Calculator


A difference calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. 
This is a popular task, for which there are many online services, such as jsondiff.
A similar mechanism is, for example, used when outputting tests or automatically tracking changes in configuration files.


### This is games use next tools:

| Tools  | Version |
|:------:|:-------:|
| python |  3.11   |
| poetry |  1.6.1  |
| pytest |  7.4.4  |
| flake8 |  6.1.0  |



### To get started, you need to perform the following operations:

| Step |                                                Instruction                                                 |
|:----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
